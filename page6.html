  <p>One of Sri Lanka's must-see locations is Yala National Park, also called Ruhuna National Park.<br><br> This outstanding game reserve,
     which is the most well-known in Sri Lanka, is situated in the southeast<br><br> of the country for good reason.  Yala is divided into five blocks 
     and occupies an area of 1,260 square<br><br> kilometers. It is believed to have the highest density of leopards per square kilometer in the world.
     The<br><br> most popular area of the reserve is Block I, which also offers the best opportunities for a leopard safari.<br><br>  Although leopards are 
     normally difficult to spot, sightings in Yala are very good; you may see them<br><br> lounging in the sun  on rocky outcrops, in trees, across paths, 
     and next to waterholes.  Sloth bears,<br><br> Asian elephants, deer, monkeys, buffalo, and several bird species coexist with leopards. 
     Yala provides<br><br> the finest chance to observe leopards in Sri Lanka if that's your top priority.

  <h1 id="wildlife">WILDLIFE OF YALA</h1><br><br>
  <p>The greatest place in Sri Lanka to witness a variety of wildlife, including sloth bears, elephants, and<br><br> leopards, is Yala National Park. 
    The park is home to 44 animal species and about 215 bird species,<br><br> including seven unique species. The park is split into five blocks, 
    the most popular of which is block I,<br><br> which is home to the majority of game drives. This block is known for having the highest density 
    of<br><br> leopards per square kilometer worldwide. Many of the younger males sunbathe on rocky rocks in<br><br> broad view, and meander languidly 
    along paths, so accustomed are they to their supremacy within the<br><br> reserve and the jeeps that come looking for them. Yala is therefore 
    the most visited national park in Sri<br><br> Lanka and draws a sizable number of tourists. Aside from the elusive sloth bears, which are small,<br><br> 
    scrubby bears that enjoy feasting on the fruits of the palu tree in May and June when they are in<br><br> season, other prominent animals in the 
    park include elephants, sambur deer, jackals, and langur<br><br> monkeys. Highlights of the area's fauna include the brown-capped babbler, 
    blue-tailed bee-eater, Sri<br><br> Lanka wood pigeon, and Sri Lanka grey hornbill, some of which are endemic. Notable inhabitants of<br><br> the park 
    include the larger adjutant and the uncommon Black-necked Stork, which is frequented by<br><br> numerous migratory species.</p><br><br>
  </section><br>

  <section>
    <h1 id="location">AREA AND LOCATION</h1><br>
    <p>Geographically speaking, Yala National Park is situated in Sri Lanka between latitudes 06°16′ and<br><br> 06°42′ North and longitudes 81°15′ 
     and 81°42′ East. The town of Tissamaharama in the Southern<br><br> Province's Hambantota District is the gateway to the Park.
     Ruhuna National Park experiences a<br><br> typically hot and dry environment due to its location in one of Sri Lanka's arid regions. 
     The region<br><br> receives its yearly rainfall in November through January during the northeast monsoon, as well as<br><br> erratic intermonsoonal 
     showers in March/April and September. Although a daily maximum of 37 C is<br><br> not unheard of during the dry season, the yearly temperature 
     close to sea level is 27 C.<br><br>

    <h1 class="yalah1-1" id="things_to_do">Top things to do in Yala National Park</h1>

    <h1 class="yalah1-1">1.Safari Rides</h1>
    <p>In Yala National Park, safari rides are a no-brainer. They offer thrilling wildlife encounters and unsettling<br><br> experiences
       that are all designed to make you appreciate the local wildlife in its natural setting. In<br><br> addition to reserving a jeep and
        driver for your safari, it is advisable to arrange for a guided tour. A<br><br> guide will show you all the best spots for
         sightseeing and be available to answer any questions you<br><br> may have or provide important information about the Park and its inhabitants.
      You may be sure to see<br><br> a wide range of wildlife, including wild boars, monitor lizards, buffalo, crested serpent eagles,<br><br> peacocks, 
      and flocks of spotter dear. Elephants, leopards, and crocodiles are uncommon sights. You<br><br> will probably see at least one elephant 
      in zone 1, as there are approximately 10-15 of them there.<br><br> Although there are thought to be 75 leopards in the about 144 square 
      kilometer area, it is uncommon<br><br> to observe even a lone leopard.
      If you love nature, spending two to three nights in Yala will maximize<br><br> your chances of seeing the creatures. Every day at 6 a.m.,
       the park opens to visitors. If you're lucky,<br><br> you might spot some animals in the early morning when they're just starting to wake 
       up and wander or<br><br> sit on the walkways! 
    </p><br><br>

    <div class="sector">
    <h1 class="yalah1-1">2.Bird Watching</h1>
    <p>With good reason, Yala is one of Sri Lanka's 70 "Important Bird Areas." The park is home to about 215<br><br> different bird species,
       seven of which are native to Sri Lanka. These include the black-capped bulbul<br><br> (Pycnonotus melanicterus), brown-capped babbler
        (Pellorneum fuscocapillus), crimson-fronted barbet<br><br> (Psilopogon rubricapillus), blue-tailed bee-eater (Merops philippinus), 
        Sri Lankan wood pigeon<br><br> (Columba torringtoniae), brown-capped babbler (Pellorneum fuscocapillus), and last but not least,
        the<br><br> Sri Lankan grey hornbill (Ocyceros gingalensis).In addition, the rare species of Purple Heron, Lesser<br><br> Flamingo, Egrets, Oriental Darters, 
        and Purple Swamphen are drawn to the lagoon in the park. Certain<br><br> waterfowl, such as the Eurasian Curlew, Whitewing Tern, Ruddy, Godwit, Whimbrel, 
        or Northern Pintail,<br><br> visit Yala Lagoons during the northeast monsoon.
