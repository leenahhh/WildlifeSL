        <h2 class="lefth1">INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p class="left-para">Situated in the south-west lowland wet zone of Sri Lanka's Sabaragamu and southern provinces, Sinharaja is a rain forest and biodiversity hotspot.
          The last remaining intact primary tropical rain forest in the nation is found in Sinharaja Rain Forest.<br>
          In addition to the abundance of endemic animals, particularly birds, the reserve is home to more than half of Sri Lanka's endemic mammal and butterfly species,
          as well as insects, reptiles, and uncommon amphibians. This is a major factor in the 1988 UNESCO World Heritage designation of Sinharaja Forest,
          then known as Sinharaja Forest Reserve. The only sizable area of unspoiled tropical rain forest on the island was initially identified as 
          Sinharaja Forest in 1936.<br>
          In 1978, UNESCO designated Sinharaja Forest as a biosphere reserve. The location is almost ready to be designated as a National Heritage Wilderness Area in 
          recognition of the necessity for the highest level of protection.</p>

        <h2 class="righth1">ABOUT</h2><br>
        <p class="right-para-for-edit">It is an excellent location for studying the process of biological evolution as well as the home of rare and endangered species. The greatest spot to see
          mixed-species bird flocks is at Sinharaja Forest. This is the largest mixed species bird flock in the world, with an average of 42 unique birds in the flocks,
          according to a study done on the subject. The world's longest bird flock study, which has been ongoing since 1981, is the mixed species bird flock research
          in Sinharaja Forest.<br><br>
        
          Research on the biodiversity of Sinharaja has shown that over 50% of the butterflies, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals are highly endemism.
          The Sambhur deer is the most prevalent species; the reserve also contains Barking and Monk deer. Although leopards are extremely rare to see in person,
          their regular presence has been verified by tracks and other indicators.<br>
          72% of the birds found in the reserve's western portion were resident non-endemic species, and 13% were migrants. 
          The 262 vertebrate species in the table below, 60 of which are endemic to Sri Lanka, have been compiled.<br>

        <p class="left-para">The Sinharaja Rainforest, situated in Sri Lanka, boasts a tropical climate characterized by warm temperatures ranging from 23 to
           30 degrees Celsius throughout the year.<br><br> High humidity is a constant feature, contributing to the lush and diverse ecosystem of the rainforest. 
           Annual rainfall in Sinharaja typically ranges from 3,000 to 6,000 millimeters, with no distinct dry season.<br><br> The southwest monsoon, occurring from 
           May to July, brings heavy rains, while the northeast monsoon, from November to January, may result in a slightly drier period.<br><br> Unlike temperate regions, 
           tropical rainforests like Sinharaja lack distinct seasons, and their consistent warmth and abundant rainfall support a remarkable array of plant and 
           animal species

            One of the best national parks in Sri Lanka for wildlife tours and bird watching, Udawalawe National Park is home to an amazing population of Asian elephants,
            as well as 184 species of birds, 33 of which are migratory, 94 types of plants, 21 fish, 12 amphibians, 33 reptiles, 43 mammals, and 135 species of butterflies.<br><br> 
            Because there are so many open grasslands in this area, Sri Lankan elephants can be found in natural settings. 
            Since its establishment in 1995, the Udawalawe Transit Home has cared for abandoned elephant calves and assisted in reintegrating

            The Udawalawe National Park is renowned for its resident population of these elephants, who are recognized subspecies of their Asian cousin.
            There are perhaps 600–700 Sri Lankan elephants living inside the boundaries of this wildlife park.<br><br> Elephants are culturally 
            significant animals that number about 5,800 on the island, according to a 2011 census conducted in Sri Lanka.
            Elephants in Sri Lanka are a threatened species.<br><br>
        
            Udawalawe is an excellent location for an unforgettable bird safari, with an astounding 183 bird species documented as residing within the Park and 
            many more passing through on their migratory paths.<br>
            The Brown-capped Babbler, Malabar pied hornbill, Sri Lanka Spurfowl, and Sri Lanka Junglefowl are notable examples of endemic species.</p>
