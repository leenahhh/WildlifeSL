        <p class="page-5-p">Lesson originally described the Sri Lankan Jungle fowl (Gallus lafeyetii) in 1831. It belongs to the same family 
          as domestic chickens, Gallus. The Red Jungle fowl (Gallus gallus) is the ancestor of all domestic chickens. It holds the unique 
          distinction of being Sri Lanka's national bird and is featured on stamps and other stationery. There are now 4 species of Gallus 
          known to exist in Asia. The four types of jungle fowl are the green (Gallus varius), red (Gallus gallus), grey (Gallus sonneratii), 
          and Sri Lankan (Gallus lafeyetii). There are no other endemic species of jungle fowl in the world besides Sri Lanka.

        <p class="page-5-p">The tiny, nocturnal red-slender loris (Loris tardigradus) is a strepsirrhine monkey that is exclusive to Sri Lanka's
           rainforests. This is species number 22 out of 100 EDGE mammal species worldwide, and number 6 out of the 10 focus species that are 
           thought to be the most globally endangered and evolutionarily different. There are now two recognized subspecies: L. t. tardigradus 
           and L. t. nycticeboides.

        <p class="page-5-p">This forest bird is restricted to the foothill and mid-hilly regions up to around 5000 feet above sea level.
           It is often observed in residential gardens and cleared areas. The Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, Kitulgala Forest, Sinharaja Rain Forest,
            Hiyare Forest Reserve, Udawattakele Forest Reserve, Kanneliya National Park, and the Riverstone region are among the places where 
            one can see the bird.

        <h3 class="page-5-h3">GOLDEN PALM CIVET</h3><br>
        <p class="page-5-p">Most Sri Lankans have encountered civets at some point in their lives. Civets are small, nocturnal mammals that are 
          native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. When referred to as Uguduwa, Kalawadda, and Hotambuwa in Sinhala or Maranai in Tamil, 
          civets can be easily identified. Humans do not make friends with these mammals, and they are frequently disregarded as a species 
          that adds to the richness of our island. Civets frequently go to new places, including suburbs and cities, where they come into 
          contact with people.

        <h3 class="page-5-h3">TOQUE MACAQUE</h3><br>
        <p class="page-5-p">The macaca is a golden-brown monkey that is unique to Sri Lanka. Known locally as the "Rilawa," this species 
          may be easily identified by the toque-shaped swirl of hair on top of its head, the amount of which varies depending on the region 
          in which it lives. Of all the monkey species, this subspecies has been the focus of one of the longest behavioral investigations 
          ever carried out.

        <h3 class="page-5-h3">BLUE MAGPIE</h3><br>
        <p class="page-5-p">The vividly colored Ceylon magpie, also known as the Sri Lanka blue magpie (Urocissa ornata), is a member 
          of the Corvidae family that is unique to Sri Lanka. This species is extremely energetic and nimble because it is accustomed 
          to hunting in the deep canopy. However, it is rarely utilized for long-distance flying because to its feeble performance. 
          The Sri Lanka blue magpie is categorized as vulnerable to extinction because of the fragmentation and degradation of its habitat, 
          which is deep primary forest in the wet zone of southern Sri Lanka, despite its capacity to adapt to human presence.

        <h3 class="page-5-h3">SLOTH BEAR</h3><br>
        <p class="page-5-p">In dry zone forests, there exists the sloth bear, the lone member of the Family Ursidae in Sri Lanka. 
          The distinctive black coat of the sloth bear is shaggy, dusty, and messy. It walks alone, keeping its nose close to the ground 
          searching for insects and fresh fruit. It makes loud grunts and snorts when it does so. The main food source for sloth bears 
          is termites and ants. 
          They hang out on the Palu trees for a long time during fruiting season because the richness and sweetness of the Palu fruits are 
          just too good to resist. Sloth bears typically give birth to a litter of two cubs The most well-known locations to see sloth bears are in the national parks of 
          Yala, Wilpattu, and Wasgomuwa

        <h3 class="page-5-h3">SRI LANKAN LEOPARD</h3><br>
        <p class="page-5-p">One of the eight recognized subspecies of leopard, the Sri Lankan Leopard (Panthera parades kotiya) is native to 
          Sri Lanka. The smallest of the "Big cats," the Sri Lankan leopard, is still the only large mammal predator in the nation and is 
          larger than its relatives that reside elsewhere.Being predatory carnivores, these incredibly graceful and agile animals are skilled 
          hunters who hunt a variety of food, including small mammals, birds, reptiles, wild boar, sambur, and barking deer, of which the 
          spotted deer consumes a bigger portion. They are best viewed at dawn and dusk, and occasionally throughout the day. They hunt 
          mostly at night.
