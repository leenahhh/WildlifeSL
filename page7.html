    <p>With a total area of 130,000 hectares, Wilpattu is the largest national park in Sri Lanka. It is also the oldest, having reopened
         after being closed for several<br><br> years due to the country's armed conflict. A few decades ago, Wilpattu's leopard population made 
         it more well-known than Yala's. One distinctive aspect of<br><br> Wilpattu is the park's large, sand-rimmed natural lakes, or "Villus,"
          which collect rainwater and draw wildlife, particularly during dry spells.

    <p class="para2">Sri Lanka is renowned for being among the top travel destinations in the world for the best animal attractions.<br><br> Because of the Wilpattu 
        National Park's enormous size and its rich soil. It has developed into one of Sri Lanka's<br><br> best places to see wildlife.
        There are around thirty different types of mammals in Willpattu National Park.<br><br> Elephants from Sri Lanka, sloth bears, spotted deer, 
        water buffaloes, and langurs all call it home. Additionally, it<br><br> is home to the Sri Lankan leopard, a species that draws a lot of tourists.
        The Sri Lankan leopard is the<br><br> dominant feline species in Sri Lanka and is arguably the most elusive in the world. Leopards in Sri Lanka 
        are<br><br> more laid-back than they are anyplace else in the world, probably because there are no lions or tigers to<br><br> endanger their status.
        They are frequently observed lounging in the treetops. Additionally, they are far larger<br><br> than leopards found in Africa or India. Not to 
        mention the vast array of bird species found in Wilpattu National<br><br> Park. These comprise the pintail, peafowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl, 
        and numerous other species.In addition, a<br><br> variety of amphibian and reptile species call this place home. The Indian rock python, 
        the Bengal monitor, the<br><br> soft-shelled turtle, and the mugger crocodile are a few examples. Wilpattu is home to a wide variety of flora 
        and<br><br> littoral plants in addition to fauna. Salt grass and low scrub monsoon forest are two examples of these.

         <h1 class="areah1" id="location">AREA AND LOCATION</h1>
         <p class="page-7-area">On Sri Lanka's northwest coast, inland, Wilpattu is situated roughly 185 km north<br><br> of Colombo and 26 km north of Puttalam. It extends 
        in the direction of Anuradhapura, the former capital. At 131, 693 hectares, the park is the<br><br> largest national park in Sri Lanka, 
        spanning the border between the North Central and North Western<br><br> Provinces! The park's west boundary is 35 kilometers long and runs 
        along Sri Lanka's northwest coast. Wilpattu<br><br> became a National Park on February 25, 1938, after being designated as a wildlife refuge 
        in 1905. Two major<br><br> rivers border Wilpattu from the north and south: the Modara Gamaru to the north of the park and the Kala Oya<br><br> to 
        the south.<br><br>

        in the Wilpattu National Park includes a driver-operated jeep, park<br><br> entrance fees, park taxes, and a pack of refreshments that includes

       <p class="page-7-p">The gravel roads of Wilpattu National Park are well-maintained, especially in the areas between the water<br><br> holes, which are excellent 
        spots to see wildlife. The most notable aspect of the national park rainforest is a<br><br> distinctive collection of more than fifty wetlands 
        resembling "everglades" that is known as "Villu". The campsite<br><br> is perfectly located for an early-morning safari before the tourists 
        arrive, as it is only five minutes from the<br><br> Wilpattu National Park boundary. Because of your proximity to the park, you can experience 
        the jungle from the<br><br> comfort of your tent. Here is your home in the wilderness.
